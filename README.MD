## DESCRIPTION:
This plugin will fix the dark car colour on Steam version.

Why don't you just use modified particle.txd, I hear you ask. You see, the replacement of particle.txd will not fix the colour of introduction cutscene vehicles. Plus, if you're playing a Russian version it will kill several translated textures. With this plugin you won't need to modify particle.txd anymore in order to fix this issue.

## SUPPORTED VERSIONS:
Steam version only (obviously)

## INSTALLATION:
Put the ASI file into your GTA III folder.
